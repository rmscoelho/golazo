A minimalist terminal user interface (TUI) for following football(i.e, soccer) matches in real-time. Get live match updates, finished match statistics, and minute-by-minute events directly in your terminal.

Golazo was created for those moments when you can't stream or watch matches live. It gives you a handy, non-intrusive, and minimalist way to keep up with your favourite football leagues.

## Notification Setup

Goal notifications require one-time setup depending on your operating system.

### macOS

Notifications use AppleScript, which requires enabling notifications for Script Editor:

1. Open **Script Editor** (`/Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app`)
2. Paste and run: `display notification "test" with title "test"`
3. Open **System Settings → Notifications → Script Editor**
4. Enable/Allow notifications and set alert style to "Banners"

### Linux

Notifications require `libnotify`. Install if not present:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libnotify-bin

# Fedora
sudo dnf install libnotify

# Arch
sudo pacman -S libnotify
```

### Windows

Notifications should work out-of-box on Windows 10/11.
